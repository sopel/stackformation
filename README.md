# StackFormation

 A collection of community templates for [AWS CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

## Status

Very early stages, not much to see/use; especially this is about tooling only so far, i.e. there are no templates migrated here yet. You can play with the tooling by means of the 
[download-aws-cloudformation-samples.py](https://github.com/sopel/stackformation/blob/master/scripts/download-aws-cloudformation-samples.py](d) helper script.

## Overview

This project aims to be a shared repository hosting community templates for [AWS CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
(and eventually [OpenStack Heat](https://github.com/openstack/heat) down the road).

### Background

There's a growing collection of [CloudFormation Sample Templates](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/) provided by AWS itself,
however, these are apparently more geared towards demonstration of available features and also do not seem to be maintained consistently (esp. they are unfortunately
not maintained as Open Source Software (OSS) on GitHub like the [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/) for example) - this project aims to complement these offerings.
